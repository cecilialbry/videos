# 🎥 Educational Videos – V2H / V2X Simulation

This repository contains a series of **educational videos** produced during my internship at LUCAMI (University of Ljubljana), within the framework of the European project **EV4EU**.

## 📌 Purpose

These videos aim to **explain the principles of smart charging for electric vehicles**, with a focus on the **Vehicle-to-Home (V2H)** approach. They are intended for a scientific audience with no specific background in energy systems.

Each video presents a **realistic use case** simulated using an interactive Python-based tool.

## 🎬 Video Content

| Video | Title | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | Introduction to V2H | Overview of the V2H concept and comparison of three cities: Paris, Ljubljana, and Athens. |
| 2️⃣ | Seasonal Impact | Analysis of V2H performance in summer vs winter. |
| 3️⃣ | Battery Size | Comparison between small and large batteries (autonomy, savings, etc.). |
| (🛠️) | ... | More videos are currently in preparation. |

## 🧪 Simulator Used

The videos are based on a **V2X simulator** developed in Python, which allows users to:
- Choose a country, month, and user consumption profile
- Select the battery type and interaction mode (V2H, V2G, etc.)
- Automatically generate KPIs and compare different scenarios

➡️ The simulator’s source code is available here: [Link to simulator repository]()
